		<h1>Well-Designed JavaScript</h1>
		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" title="Wikipedia: JavaScript is a scripting language used to enable programmatic access to objects within other applications. It is primarily used in the form of client-side JavaScript for the development of dynamic websites.">JavaScript</a> should not make any assumptions about browser support. Ideally, pages using scripting should also be usable when scripting is turned off, so that more basic browsers (for example, mobile phones or Kindles) can also be used for using the page.</p>

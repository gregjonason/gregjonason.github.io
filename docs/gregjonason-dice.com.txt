Research

I am an Ed.D. student in the Department of Curriculum & Instruction
(http://www.coe.uh.edu/academic-departments/cuin/index.php) at the University of Houston
(http://www.uh.edu/). My dissertation research involves how the knowledge discovery process
(KDP) relates to student retention and data extracted from the university's PeopleSoft data
warehouse. My academic advisor is Dr. Sara McNeil (http://faculty.coe.uh.edu/smcneil/). My
research interests include data preparation, KDP, student retention, data visualization and
platform architecture.

Work

My role was Educational Technology Manager for Texas School Ready (TSR) at The Children's
Learning Institute (http://www.childrenslearninginstitute.org) (CLI). CLI is a part of The
University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) (http://www.uth.edu) located in
the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas. My work specializations and interests include
platform architecture and design, system integration, and data analytics. I served as project
manager for the design and implementation of a state-wide child progress monitoring and
professional development learning platform by the name of CLI Engage (https://cliengage.org).

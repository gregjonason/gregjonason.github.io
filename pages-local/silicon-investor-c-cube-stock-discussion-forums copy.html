Sony Teams With Digital Technology Leaders for World Wide Web-Cast of NASA Space Shuttle Missions<br>
<br>
Business Wire - September 25, 1997 17:32<br>
<br>
MONTVALE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 25, 1997-- <br>
<br>
Sony, WorldLink, Microsoft, Compaq, NextLevel Systems, Others to Web-Cast Three Missions <br>
<br>
In a coordinated effort that breaks new ground in both form and content, Sony Electronics, Microsoft, and WorldLink (a leading Internet Service and Media Content Provider), along with other leaders in digital technology, are joining forces to bring NASA Space Shuttle events to the World Wide Web. <br>
<br>
Visitors to WorldLink's Web site (http://www.wl.net) will be able not only to read and hear interviews with the astronauts, but also view live and archived footage created using Sony's DSR-130 DVCAM digital video camera and transmitted through the Web using Microsoft's NetShow 2.0 software(TM). <br>
<br>
According to Greg Johnson, Manager of Operations for WorldLink, the company contacted leaders in digital technology so that its highly innovative Web-casting system is powerful and reliable. System components include, among others, software from Microsoft Corporation, server communications technology from Compaq, satellite data communications from NextLevel Systems and digital video cameras and VTRs from Sony. <br>
<br>
"We are very proud to be participants in the first-ever live Space Shuttle launch broadcast on the Internet using the newest digital technologies. We have found that the combination of Sony's DVCAM digital cameras, Compaq ProLiant(TM) servers, Microsoft's NT Server and NetShow technology creates a perfect solution for delivering high quality audio and video over the Internet," said Johnson. <br>
<br>
"The high-quality digital video captured using Sony's digital cameras is transmitted by satellite uplink from Kennedy Space Center to WorldLink's headquarters in Houston with NextLevel's digital satellite technology, where it is broadcast onto the Internet using Microsoft's NetShow Server running on a Compaq ProLiant 5000R," said Johnson. "Now people around the world can watch the launches live via the Internet." <br>
<br>
"We went to Sony first because of the company's reputation and standing in the industry," said Johnson. "When we saw the specifications and the camera's performance, we were even more determined to work with DVCAM(TM) equipment. Video capture is moving to digital, and our goal is to go with cutting edge technology in every facet of this project." <br>
<br>
"This project sets a new precedent for Web content creation. Putting the DSR-130 on the front line offers us an excellent chance to demonstrate the camera's video quality and ease-of-use," said Robert Ott, director of video communications for Sony Electronics' Business and Professional Group. "DVCAM equipment allows WorldLink to create the video content without extensive training or compatibility issues." <br>
<br>
The DVCAM DSP cameras, along with DVCAM VTRs and other production and editing equipment, will be used to record press conferences, interviews, launches and landings in conjunction with three space shuttle missions. The Space Shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to launch today, September 25, and the Shuttle Columbus is slated for a November 19 launch date. <br>
<br>
Sony's DSR-130 <br>
<br>
The DSR-130, Sony's high end DVCAM acquisition system, has a suggested list price of $19,400 and provides advanced features engineered to facilitate high-end videography applications. This capture system is comprised of the DXC-D30 camera docked with the DSR-1 DVCAM video tape recorder. Separately, the DSR-1 dockable recorder has a suggested list price of $7,400 and the DXC-D30L camera has a suggested list price of $12,000. <br>
<br>
According to Ott, the DVCAM DSR-130 has quickly become an established leader in digital video production by giving everyone from the independent videographers to major post houses the features and video quality they need with a price and migration path with which they can work. <br>
<br>
According to Ott, this is Sony's second project involving the Space Shuttle Atlantis mission scheduled for September 25. The DSR-130 and DSR-PD1 camcorders are also being used to record a full length documentary based on the lives of crew members for the year leading up to and including the mission. <br>

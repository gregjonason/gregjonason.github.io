Pascal Family History
A surname, often referred to as a last name or family name, is a name passed down through a family from generation to generation. Though each culture has its own norms, in the West the surname is typically inherited from the paternal (father’s) line. In ancient times, people were often referred to by their given name and place alone. Hereditary surnames developed to distinguish individuals with the same first name, a necessity as world populations grew—it wasn’t until the 11th century that surnames began to be used throughout Europe.
Perhaps you’ve wondered, ‘What does my last name mean?’ In fact, the answer may be right in front of you. Most surnames were originally derived from a father’s given name, e.g., “Hanson” (the son of Han); from places or geographical features, “Hill”; occupations, “Fisher”; or personal descriptions like “White.” Please bear in mind, surnames may have changed spellings or been replaced entirely over time.
This report will provide you with a rich introduction into the history of your surname, deepening your knowledge of and connection to your ancestors.

The Second World War (1939-1945) began with the German invasion of Poland in 1939, the first gesture in what would become a German effort to establish an empire through forcible conquest. The event evolved into a global military conflict, recorded as the deadliest war in world history. Sixteen million Americans heroically served in the armed forces, and 400,000 American deaths will be forever mourned.

Immigration Records
Anyone with European bloodlines is descended, at least in part, from immigrants. Looking back generations, we’re almost certain to encounter one. From the colonial period onward, waves of immigrants have traveled to the United States searching for a better life, and prosperity. In the 17th and 18th centuries, historians estimate nearly one million immigrants crossed the Atlantic Ocean, settling in Colonial America—including more than 175,000 Englishmen. Millions of Europeans immigrated to the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries; 30 million from 1836 to 1914 alone.

Before the 1930s, ship was the only viable mode of transport before trans-Atlantic flight was possible. Ship passenger lists therefore provide information we can use to find out more about where our ancestors came from, and tell us about their voyage. You may learn your ancestor’s place of birth, the ship name, their age, height, eye and hair color, and profession, to name a few.

A quick search reveals that Pascals were among the millions that immigrated to the U.S. over the past several centuries.

Do you have a famous musician in the family? A patent holder? A politician? These are just a few of the things we can learn about our ancestors from historical newspaper pages; facts that may be documented nowhere else in the world. The U.S. newspaper is a long tradition, stemming back to the first colonial newspapers published in the 17th century. Much as they do today, local publications captured not only national headlines but the day-to-day happenings of American communities.

Preserved newspaper pages enable us to step into the shoes of our ancestors, and not only learn about them personally, but also immerse ourselves in the current events of their day. And it turns out Pascals made the headlines quite a bit.

Additional Information
We‘ve found additional background on the Pascal surname we’d like to share with you.

Pascal (p(a)-scal, pas-cal) is a masculine Francophone given name derived from the Latin paschalis or pashalis , which means relating to Easter from Latin Pascha (Easter), in turn from the Hebrew pesach , which means to be born on, or to be associated with, Passover day. Since the Hebrew holiday Passover coincides closely with the later Christian holiday of Easter, the Latin word came to be used for both occasions.

The names Paschal, Pasqual, Pasquale, Pascali, Pascale, Pascha, Pascual, Pascoe and Pasco are all variations of Pascal . The feminine form is Pascale or Pascalle or Pascalina . Pascal is also common as a surname.
